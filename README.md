# Housing Data

I am passionate about housing justice. As I continue to learn and practice data science skills, I'm going to use housing data to apply these skills to projects about this topic that I care very deeply about. 

Currently, I have one project looking at the 2024 median rental prices by county, using data from HUD. This project contains a jupyter notebook (MedianRent2024.ipynb) and a project report summarizing the notebook (MedianRent2024.pdf). This project was done to complete the honors requirements for the online course Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning, offered by IBM through Coursera.
