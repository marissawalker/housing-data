# Housing Data

I am passionate about housing justice. As I continue to learn and practice data science skills, I'm going to use housing data to apply these skills to projects about this topic that I care very deeply about. 

Projects:

1. Median Rent 2024: This project looks at the 2024 median rental price estimates by county in the USA, using data from the department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This project contains a jupyter notebook (MedianRent2024.ipynb) and a project report summarizing the notebook (MedianRent2024.pdf). This project was done to complete the honors requirements for the online course Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning, offered by IBM through Coursera.
2. House Prices 2022: This project looks at the average house price estimates for each state (+DC) in the USA in 2022 from Zillow, and uses different types of linear regression to explore connections between that data and other various economic/demographic indicators (population, poverty, unemployment, and education). This project was done to complete the honors requirements for the online course Supervised Machine Learning: Regression, offered by IBM through Coursera.
